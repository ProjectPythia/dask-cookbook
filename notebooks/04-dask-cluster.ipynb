    "## Introduction\n",
    "As we mentioned in our Dask overview, Dask is composed of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dask Collections (APIs)\n",
    "2. Dynamic Task Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have talked about different Dask collections, but in this tutorial we are going to talk more about the second part. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dask scheduler - our task orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dask.distributed` task *scheduler* is a centralized, dynamic system that coordinates the efforts of various dask *worker* processes spread accross different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a computational task is submitted, the Dask distributed *scheduler* sends it off to a Dask *cluster* - simply a collection of Dask *workers*. A worker is typically a separate Python process on either the local host or a remote machine.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\" markdown=\"1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* **worker** - a Python interpretor which will perform work on a subset of our dataset.\n",
    "* **cluster** - an object containing instructions for starting and talking to workers.\n",
    "* **scheduler** - sends tasks from our task graph to workers.\n",
    "* **client** - a local object that points to the scheduler (*often local but not always*). </div>\n",

    "## Schedulers\n",
    "Dask essentially offers two types of schedulers:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Single machine scheduler \n",
    "* The Single-machine Scheduler schedules tasks and manages the execution of those tasks on the same machine where the scheduler is running.  \n",
    "* It is designed to be used in situations where the amount of data or the computational requirements are too large for a single process to handle, but not large enough to warrant the use of a cluster of machines.\n",
    "* It is relatively simple and cheap to use but it does not scale as it only runs on a single machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Single machine scheduler is the default choice used by Dask.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Dask, there are several types of single machine schedulers that can be used to schedule computations on a single machine:\n",
    "#### 1.1. Single-threaded scheduler\n",
    "This scheduler runs all tasks **serially** on a single thread.  \n",
    "This is only useful for debugging and profiling, but does not have any parallelization. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Threaded scheduler\n",
    "The threaded scheduler uses a pool of **local** threads to execute tasks concurrently.  \n",
    "This is the default scheduler for Dask, and is suitable for most use cases on a single machine. Multithreading works well for Dask Array and Dask DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "To select one of the above scheduler for your computation, you can specify it when doing `.compute()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "this.compute(scheduler=\"single-threaded\")  # for debugging and profiling only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above the *threaded scheduler* is the default scheduler in Dask. But you can set the default scheduler to Single-threaded or multi-processing by: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dask\n",
    "dask.config.set(scheduler='synchronous')  # overwrite default with single-threaded scheduler\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-processing works well for pure Python code - *delayed* functions and operations on Dask Bags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare the performance of each of these single-machine schedulers:"
